# Intermediate Object Oriented Programming

### Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Identify requirements, data, and processes for an OOP problem
* Translate a high level OOP design into code

### Solving Problems With Object Oriented Programming

Object oriented programming is a powerful tool for solving problems in your code, but it takes some practice before the concepts are solidified in your head.

Here are some suggestions for helping you solve these problems:

1. Ask lots of questions about requirements
	1. How should the app work in a certain case (think about edge cases)
	2. What data is given?
	3. Can I make an assumption about X or Y?
	4. Will data be given in a certain format?
	5. How would I test this app?
2. List all the requirements (don't worry about grouping things into classes or functions yet)
3. Break the problem down! Group requirements into related functionality
4. Decide what classes should exist, what data the classes own, and what operations the classes need
5. To help organize your thoughts, diagram the classes. Keep track of what is being inherited from what or which classes own other classes.
6. Code!!!

### Pong - OOP Example



### Diagraming

Now that we have grouped some of the objects in the program, let's diagram it.  This can be as simple as a hand written drawing to help organize your thoughts.


### Exercise

Implement a tic tac toe game using OOP.  The starter code is in the  [tic tac toe](https://github.com/rithmschool/intermediate_js_exercises/tree/master/intermediate_oop/tic_tac_toe) folder of the intermediate javascript exercises repo.
