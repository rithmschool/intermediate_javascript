# Call, Apply, and Bind

### Objectives:

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Compare and contrast the parameters and return values of `call`, `apply`, and `bind`
- Discuss use cases for each of these methods
- Change the context of the keyword `this` using `call`, `apply`, and `bind`

### A quick review of the keyword this

In the [previous chapter](./04-the-keyword-this.md), we mentioned four ways to determine the value of the keyword `this`:

1. Default binding - catch all rule, when the keyword `this` is in the global context
2. Implicit Binding - when the keyword `this` is attached to a parent object
3. Explicit Binding - when we want to explicitly set the context for the keyword `this`
4. The `new` keyword - when the `new` keyword is used, the keyword `this` refers to an object that is created from a function after the `new` keyword (usually called a _constructor function_).

As we mentioned before, in this chapter we'll focus on the third way to determine the value of the keyword `this`: explicit binding. To explicitly bind the keyword `this` we can use one of three functions: `call`, `apply`, or `bind`.

### `call`

`call` will immediately invoke the function that it is attached to. If you want to change the value of the keyword `this`, you can pass in the desired value as the first parameter to `call` (oftentimes this first argument is written in documentation as `thisArg`). Here's an example:
```javascript
var animal = {
	introduce: function() {
		return this.name + " is a " + this.type + " and says " + this.sound + "!";
	}
};

var whiskey = {
	name: "Whiskey",
	type: "dog",
	sound: "woof"
};

var moxie = {
	name: "Moxie",
	type: "cat",
	sound: "meow"
};

// set the thisArg to be the object whiskey:
animal.introduce.call(whiskey); // "Whiskey is a dog and says woof!"

// set the thisArg to be the object moxie:
animal.introduce.call(moxie); // "Moxie is a cat and says meow!"
```

The second to n-th parameters of `call` are the parameters of the function you are immediately invoking, separated by commas. Here's an example passing multiple arguments into `call`:

```javascript
var person1 = {
	name: "Matt",
	greet: function(otherName) {
		return "Hi, " + otherName + ", I'm " + this.name + ". Nice to meet you!";
	}
}

var person2 = { 
	name: "Tim"
}

// person1 greets person2:

person1.greet(person2.name); // "Hi Tim, I'm Matt. Nice to meet you!

// person2 tries to greet person1, but there's a problem...

person2.greet(person1.name); // TypeError: person2.greet is not a function

// person2 doesn't have a greet method! So let's borrow the one from person1...

person1.greet.call(person2); // "Hi, undefined, I'm Tim. Nice to meet you!"

// We still need to pass person1's name to the function being called! Let's pass the argument to the function inside of call:

person1.greet.call(person2, person1.name); // "Hi, Matt, I'm Tim. Nice to meet you!"
```

### Use case for call

One of the most common use cases for `call` is to convert an array-like object into an actual array. Take a look at the following example:

```javascript
function sumArgumentsIncorrectly(){
    return arguments.reduce(function(acc,next){
        return acc+next;
    },0);
}

sumArgumentsIncorrectly(1,2,3,4,5) // this throws a type error because the arguments "array like object" does not contain the method reduce!

function sumArgumentsCorrectly(){
    // we are going to use the slice method which makes copies of arrays, but instead of making a copy of [], we will use the arguments array as the context that we want slice to be called in. We can immediately attach reduce and we are good to go!
    return [].slice.call(arguments).reduce(function(acc,next){
        return acc+next;
    },0)
}

sumArgumentsCorrectly(1,2,3,4,5) // 15
```

### Apply

`apply` is very similar to `call`, except it only takes in a maximum of two arguments. The first is the same as `call`, but the second is always an array (`[]`) of parameters. In other words, `fn.call(thisArg,arg1,arg2,arg3)` will produce the same result as `fn.apply(thisArg,[arg1,arg2,arg3])` for any function `fn`, this argument `thisArg`, and arguments `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3`.

So when should you use `call` and when should you use `apply`? If you don't have to pass any additional arguments to the function on which you're calling `call` or `apply`, it doesn't matter: you can use either one. If you do need to pass arguments to the function, do whatever's most convenient in the present context. If you have an array of parameters to pass, or you don't know exactly how many arguments you'll be passing, `apply` might be a better bet. If you only have one argument to pass, or you always know which arguments you'll need to pass, maybe `call` is a better bet.

```javascript
var matt = {
	firstName: "Matt",
	lastName: "Lane",
	instructor: true,
	favColor: "blue",
	dogOwner: true,
	deleteInfo: function() {
        console.log(arguments);
		for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
			delete this[arguments[i]];
		}
	}
}

var tim = {
	firstName: "Tim",
	lastName: "Garcia",
	instructor: true,
	favColor: "blue",
	dogOwner: false
};

var elie = {
	firstName: "Elie",
	lastName: "Schoppik",
	instructor: true,
	favColor: "purple",
	dogOwner: false
};

matt.deleteInfo(['instructor', 'favColor']);
matt; // {firstName: "Matt", lastName: "Lane", dogOwner: true}

matt.deleteInfo.apply(tim,['firstName', 'dogOwner', 'favColor']);
tim; // {lastName: "Garcia", instructor: true}

matt.deleteInfo.apply(elie,['instructor','favColor','dogOwner','lastName']);
elie; // {firstName: "Elie"}
```

### Use case for apply

Here are two common cases where you'll see apply being used. One involves the use of the `Math.max` function. This function returns the maximum number in a comma-separated list of numbers, but you can also use `apply` to find the maximum value of an array:

```javascript
var numbersArray = [1,2,3,4,5];

Math.max.apply(this,numbersArray) // 5
```

Another use-case involves taking an array of arrays and flattening it, so that all the inner arrays are removed (but the values inside of them are preserved). Here's how you could do this using `apply`:

```
var arrayToBeFlattened = [1,2,[3,4],[5,6]]

[].concat.apply([],arrayToBeFlattened) // [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

### Bind

Just like `call`, bind takes in as its first parameter what we would like the context of the keyword `this` to be and the 2nd to n-th parameters are the arguments to the function. However, bind does not immediately invoke the function - it returns a function definition that can be called at a later point in time (or right away, but you will very rarely do this). In other words, `fn.bind(thisArg,arg1,arg1,arg3)()` (note the parentheses at the end!!) does the same thing as `fn.call(thisArg,arg1,arg2,arg3)`.

```javascript
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}

var partialAdd = add.bind(this,2)
partialAdd(4) // 6
```

### A review of Closure

In a previous unit we mentioned that closure is:

>When a function is able to access variables from an outer function that has already returned.

We see that the bind function returns a new function to us, so what bind is doing is simply using closure! Let's take a look a reimplementation of a simpler version of `bind` (JavaScript's implementation is quite a bit more complex).

```javascript
function bind(fn,thisArg){
    var outerArgs = [].slice.call(arguments)
    var argsWeWant = outerArgs.slice(2) // we don't want the fn and thisArg values! Let's copy from the 2nd index of the arguments array to the end!
    return function(){
        return fn.apply(thisArg,argsWeWant.concat([].slice.call(arguments))) // remember that the 2nd parameter of apply takes in an array. So we are concatenating (joining) the arguments from the outer function with the arguments from the inner function to form 1 big array of arguments to be used when the inner function is finally called.
    }
}

function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}

// check out some cool stuff we can do with our bind function now!

bind(add,this,1,11)() // 12
bind(add,this)(1,11) // 12
bind(add,this,1)(11) // 12
bind(add,this,1)(11,5,6,7,8,9) // 12 - the rest are ignored!
```

### Use case for bind

A very common use case for bind is when you don't want to lose the correct context of the keyword `this`, but also do not want to execute the function immediately: 

```javascript
var obj = {
    firstName: "Elie",
    sayHi: function(){
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log(this.firstName + " says hi!");
        },1000);
    }.bind(this)
}
```

In this example, we are ensuring that we get the correct context of the keyword `this`. If we did not use the `bind(this)` - the context of the keyword `this` would be the Window object, because when the callback inside of the `setTimeout` executes, it does not do so as a method on `obj`, so it loses the implicit binding. In particular the `window` does not have `firstName` property! 

So why did we not use `call` or `apply`? Remember that `bind` does not execute the function right away. Instead it just returns a function definition. For the example above that is exactly what we want, because we don't want to run the function right away: we want to wait 1000 milliseconds!
