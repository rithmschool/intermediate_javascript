# Project

It's time to combine everything you have learned so far in the previous couple units to build a fun project! This application should make use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (you can use jQuery if you'd like). You should also feel free to try your hand at some more complex technologies - here is a list of some interesting libraries, APIs and frameworks:

- [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
- [Phaser](http://phaser.io/)
- [YouTube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/)
- [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
- [A Public API](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

At this point you can build another game, a more dynamic personal website, a productivity tool using any of these public APIs, and many more possibilities!
