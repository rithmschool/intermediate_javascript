# EcmaScript2015

### Objectives:

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Refactor code to use `let` and `const` and explain the implications of using both
- Use template strings and default parameters in your JavaScript code
- Use arrow functions and explain the difference between them and the `function` keyword
- Utilize ES2015 operators like spread and rest
- Use object shorthand notation and destructuring for objects and arrays
- Explain what the the `class` keyword in ES2015 does

### `let` and `const`

ES2015 brings us some new words to declare variables, along with a new kind of scope. So far we have only seen `global` and `function` scope, but the keyword `let` gives us access to `block` scope. You can think of blocks as code inside of curly braces that are not part of an object or function definition. Blocks exist in `if` statements, `for/while` loops, `switch` statements and `try/catch` blocks. Here are some examples:

```javascript
let instructor = "Elie";
if (instructor === "Elie") {
    let anotherInstructor = "Tim";
}
anotherInstructor; // ReferenceError! This would not be true if we had used `var` instead of `let`.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.log(i);
    },1000);
}
// try replacing let i = 0 by var i = 0 in the above. What happens... and why?
```

ES2015 also gives us another keyword `const` which allows us to create constants. You can think of a constant as variables that can not be reassigned.

```javascript
const favoriteFood = "Pad Thai";
const favoriteFood = "Pad See Ew";
// Uncaught TypeError: Identifier 'favoriteFood' has already been declared(…)
const person;
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

### Template strings

ES2015 gives us string interpolation using back ticks (\`\`) and adding our variables in a `${}`. Here is an example:

```javascript
`Now we can do string interpolation like ${1+1}`;

var person = "Elie";

`My name is ${person}`;
```

String interpolation can make working with strings much more convenient, because it allows us to avoid having to do a lot of string concatenation:

```javascript
var firstName = "Matt";
var lastName = "Lane";
var title = "instructor";
var employer = "Rithm";

// ughhh, so much concatenation...
var greeting1 = "Hi, my name is " + firstName + " " + lastName + ", and I'm an " + title + " at " + employer + "!";

// much better
var greeting2 = `Hi, my name is ${firstName} ${lastName}, and I'm an ${title} at ${employer}!`;
```

### Default parameters

Another nice feature is the ability to add default values to parameters in our functions

```javascript

// OLD - causes unintended issues because 0 is falsey!

function add(a, b){
    a = a || 12
    b = b || 13
    return a + b;
}

add() // 25
add(0) // 25 - WHY IS THIS??
add(0,0) // 25 - WHAT IS HAPPENING??

// NEW
function add(a=12,b=13){
    return a+b
}

add() // 25
add(0) // 13 - CORRECT!
add(10,10) // 20
```

### Arrow functions

As an alternative to the keyword `function`, ES2015 gives us a new function syntax called `arrow functions`. These functions are denoted by the `=>` character(s). While they are very similar to the `function` keyword. Arrow functions have a few key differences.

- If the arrow function is all on 1 line - an implicit `return` is added (you do not need the keyword `return`).
- If the arrow function is on more than one line, `{}` must be used (just like a regular `function`)
- If the arrow function takes 1 argument, you don't need to wrap that argument in parentheses (though for multiple arguments, you do)
- Arrow functions are **always** anonymous

Let's see some examples:

```javascript
// basic examples: 
var add = (a, b) => a + b;
var shout = str => str.toUpperCase();
var multilineArrowFunction = (a) => {
	let b = a * a;
	return b + a;
}

// callback examples:
var arr = [1,2,3,4];

// function keyword syntax
arr.map(function(val){
    return val*2;
})

// arrow function syntax
arr.map(val => val *2)
```

Another important distinction between arrow functions and functions defined using the `function` keyword has to do with the keyword `this`. Arrow functions lexically bind the `this` value. What does that mean? From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions): 
	
>Until arrow functions, every new function defined its own this value (a new object in case of a constructor, undefined in strict mode function calls, the context object if the function is called as an "object method", etc.). This proved to be annoying with an object-oriented style of programming.

Ok, but what does _that_ mean? Let's take a look at an example:

```javascript
var obj = {
    firstName: "Elie",
    sayHi: function(){
        setTimeout(function(){
            console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.firstName);
        },1000)
    }
}
```

If you call `obj.sayHi()` in this example, you'll see that "Hi, I'm undefined" gets logged to the console one second later. This is because the callback to `setTimeout` loses the context of `this`, as it isn't being called as a method on `obj`.

When using an arrow function for this callback, however, the arrow function keeps its context from the enclosing context: in this case, it will refer to the `obj` object, and the `console.log` will work as expected:

```javascript
var objES2015 = {
    firstName: "Elie",
    sayHi: function(){
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.firstName}`);
        },1000)
    }
}
```

### Rest / Spread

ES2015 gives us two new operators with the same syntax. The first is the `rest` operator (think of it like the "rest" of the arguments), and is used inside of a list of function parameters in the definition of a function to indicate the "rest" of the arguments:

```javascript
function data(a,b,...c){
    console.log(a,b,c);
}

data(1,2,3,4,5); // 1, 2, [3,4,5]
```

The `spread` operator (which you can think of as spreading an array into a set of comma separated values) also uses a `...`, but unlike the `rest` operator, `spread` is used when calling a function:

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4];
function addFourNumbers(a,b,c,d){
    return a + b + c + d;
}
addFourNumbers(...arr);
```

You can read more about rest [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters) and spread [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator).

### Object shorthand notation + destructuring assignment  

ES2015 gives us quite a few enhancements on objects, which allow us to write more concise code with less repetition. Let's see what that looks like:

```javascript
var obj = {
    firstName: "Elie",
    sayHi: function(){
        return "Hello from ES5!";
    },
    sayBye() {
        return "Bye from ES2015!";
    }
}

var person = "Elie";
var es5Object = {person: person};
es5Object; // {person: "Elie"}

var es2015Object = {person};
es2015Object; // {person: "Elie"}
```

In the first example, note that in ES2015, when you're adding a method to an object, you can eliminate the colon and the `function` keyword. In other words, these two are essentially equivalent:

```javascript
var o1 = {
  sayYo: function() {
    console.log("Yo!");
  }
};

var o2 = {
  sayYo() {
    console.log("Yo!");
  }
}
```

The other example shows that you can pass a variable into an object instead of a key-value pair, and JavaScript will convert the variable name into the key for you.

### Destructuring assignment syntax

ES2015 also gives us access to the destructuring assignment syntax for objects and arrays. From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment):

>The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects into distinct variables. This can be useful if you want to assign multiple variables at once:

```javascript
var obj = {
    a:1,
    b:2,
    c:3
};

var {a,b,c} = obj;

a; // 1
b; // 2
c; // 3
```

In the same way that we can destructure objects, we can also destructure arrays (which are really just a special type of an object).

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4];
var [a,b,c,d] = arr;

a; // 1
b; // 2
c; // 3
d; // 4

var [first,second] = [1,2];

first; // 1
second; // 2
```

Array destructuring also allows us to swap the values in two variables succinctly. This can be useful if, for instance, you're writing a function which randomly shuffles elements in an array by swapping pairs of elements. Here's an example:

```javascript
var [a, b] = [1, 2];
a; // 1
b; // 2

[a, b] = [b, a];
a; // 2
b; // 1
```

### Class syntax

Although this addition to the language is not widely loved by the community, it is important to understand because modern frameworks like React and Angular 2 use it quite frequently. All that this syntax does is obfuscate constructor functions and prototype properties/methods. There is nothing new going on here; it is just a layer of abstraction. Let's recall what this looked like in ES5:

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName){
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
}

Person.prototype.sayHi = function(){
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + " says hello!";   
}

Person.isPerson(person){
    return person.constructor === Person;
}
```

Here is what an ES2015 Implementation looks like:

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName){
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    sayHi(){
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} says hello!`;
    }
    static isPerson(person){
        return person.constructor === Person;
    }
}
```

The function called `constructor` MUST be named that way (since that is what is run when the `new` keyword is used). If you just try to run `Person()` you will get a TypeError with the message that "Class constructor Person cannot be invoked without 'new'".

If we want to add functions directly on the "class" (which is really a function), we use the word `static`.
